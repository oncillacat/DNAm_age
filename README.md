# this DNAm-age method works with SESAME package   
This code works with SESAME package, starting from IDAT file and ends up with boxplots. This method is developed to get publishable graph from MM285 Infinium Mouse DNA Methylation BeadChip for results in DNA methlation age. 

What I posted here is my draft working files from last years with Dr.Zelikoff's lab at NYU langone health, hopes that will help. A more complete version of code will be updated to this branch after the paper is published.
